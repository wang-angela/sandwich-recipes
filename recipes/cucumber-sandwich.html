    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>

      <li>Cucumbers sliced</li>
      <li>Your favorite bread (Mine is sourdough)</li>
      <li>Mayonnaise or Dijon Mustard</li>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>

      <li>Spread mayonnaise or mustard on each slice of bread. If you're using
        mustard, make sure to not add too much as the flavor can be overpowering
